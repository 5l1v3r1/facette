What is Facette?
----------------

[Facette][0] is a graphing web front-end.

At its current development state, Facette only supports RRD files as back-end and has originally been developed as a
Collectd front-end. But it is planned to have more back-end support in the future (e.g. Whisper or Graphite).

Its code is available at [Github][1], and is licensed under the terms of the [BSD license][2].

/!\ Important: Facette is currently under development and is **not ready** for a production environment.
